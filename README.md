## Quick Start

1. Star and Fork [PongHub](https://github.com/WCY-dt/ponghub)

2. Modify the [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) file in the root directory to configure your service checks.

3. Modify the [`CNAME`](CNAME) file in the root directory to set your custom domain name.
   
   > If you do not need a custom domain, you can delete the `CNAME` file.

4. Commit and push your changes to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically run and deploy to GitHub Pages and require no intervention.

> [!TIP]
> By default, GitHub Actions runs every 30 minutes. If you need to change the frequency, modify the `cron` expression in the [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file.
> 
> Please do not set the frequency too high to avoid triggering GitHub's rate limits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If GitHub Actions does not trigger automatically, you can manually trigger it once.
> 
> Please ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled and that you have granted notification permissions for GitHub Actions.
